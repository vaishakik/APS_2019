Look up table for array query:->
>Look up table is used for storing the calculated values in tables and retrived again instead of calculating again. 
>The memory required is n*n of memory of datatypes. 
>Time taken is n*n.

Square root decomposition for array query problem:->
>The time taken is n.
>Used when array elements are increasing or changing.
>The memory used is square root of n.Less compared to look up table.
>Accessing time is square root of n.

Kadane algorithm(maximum sub-array sum):->
>Time complexity is O(n),as there is one for loop.
>Space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant space.

Segment tree:->
>It is used if n is  large value and the values are static.
>There are total (2*n-1) nodes.
>Time complexity:
-->for query is O(logn).
-->for tree construction is O(n).
-->for updating an element is O(logn).
