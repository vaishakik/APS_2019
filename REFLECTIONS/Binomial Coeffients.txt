The triangular array of binomial coefficients lead to Pascal triangle.
Methods to calculate the binomial coefficients (nCr) are:-
1->2d matrix using Dynamic Programming.
   +This method makes a lookup table.
   +Can get intermediate values instead of re-calculating the values.
   +Space complexity->(N*K).
2->Recursion 
   +This methos same memory as of the dynamic programming.
   +Takes same time as of the above,but takes more time for larger value of n and r.
   +Space Compexity->(2^(n-1)).
3->1D array  
   +This method used when we require value of only particular binomail coeeficient.
   +Space complexity of (k+1).
